# Stopping-Criteria-Systematic-Reviews

This repository contains code to run the search stopping criteria algorithms as described in the paper "Robust and Efficient Stopping Criteria for Systematic Reviews Using Poisson Processes"  by Alison Sneyd and Mark Stevenson (paper currently under review).

The main results in the paper can be replicated by downloading a copy of the 2017 CLEF TAR data (available at https://github.com/CLEF-TAR/tar) into the repository's data folder and running: 

python process_data.py

and then running the Jupyter Notebooks:
